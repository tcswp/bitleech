A barebones CLI-based BitTorrent client with UDP tracker support. I call it nTorrent (n stands for nano) because it's an order of magnitude smaller than Î¼Torrent.

To do:

- [ ] endgame mode
- [ ] upload
- [ ] connection rating to maximize dl rate
- [ ] magnet uri
- [ ] possibly DHT
- [ ] save blocks and assign to other peer if peer times out
- [x] save state to file
- [ ] update tracker with announce periodically
